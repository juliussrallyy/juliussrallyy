            I see you
            You see me
            How pleasant
            This feeling
            The moment
            You hold me
            I missed you
            I'm sorry
            I've given
            What I have
            I showed you
            I'm growing
            The ashes
            Fall slowly
            As your voice
            Consoles me

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know
            As the hours pass
            I will let you know

            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know

            We're swaying
            To drum beats
            In motion
            I'm feeling
            My patience
            Controlling
            The question
            I won't speak
            We're telling
            The stories
            Our laughter
            He knows me
            We're leaving
            We're talking
            You're closer
            It's calming

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know

            The night will hold us close
            And the stars will guide us home
            I've been waiting for this moment
            We're finally alone
            I turn to ask the question
            So anxious, my thoughts
            Your lips were soft like winter
            In your passion, I was lost

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know

            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know
            As the hours pass
            I will let you know
            That I need to ask
            Before I'm alone
            How it feels to rest
            On your patient lips
            To eternal bliss
            I'm so glad to know
